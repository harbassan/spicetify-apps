### Manual Installation

Download the files in the [dist branch](https://github.com/harbassan/spicetify-stats/archive/refs/heads/dist.zip), rename the unzipped folder to `stats`, then place that folder into your `CustomApps` folder in the `spicetify` directory and you're all done. If everything's correct, the structure should be similar to this:

```
📦spicetify\CustomApps
 ┣ 📂marketplace
 ┣ etc...
 ┗ 📂stats
 ┃ ┣ 📜extension.js
 ┃ ┣ 📜index.js
 ┃ ┣ 📜manifest.json
 ┃ ┗ 📜style.css
```

Finally, run these commands to apply:

```powershell
spicetify config custom_apps stats
spicetify apply
```

That's it. Enjoy.

### Uninstallation

To uninstall the app, run these commands:

```powershell
spicetify config custom_apps stats-
spicetify apply
```

If you want to remove the app completely, just delete the `stats` folder after running the above commands.
